= Overview

The goal of this project is to provide some level of security for a simple HTTP endpoint running on an AWS EC2 instance.  The HTTP endpoint has no security built in.

== Real World

I am deploying Prometheus node-exporter on some non-OpenShift hosts and scraping the endpoints from an OpenShift cluster.  I do not want to add additional software on these hosts beyond node-exporter if possible.  I'm 100% in AWS with this infrastructure and am willing to use AWS specific components.

= Setup

Make sure you have aws credentials setup.
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --region=us-east-1
```

And you have all dependencies:
```
pip install boto
ansible-galaxy install cloudalchemy.node-exporter
```

== Create VM

```
ansible-playbook setup-ec2.yml
```
